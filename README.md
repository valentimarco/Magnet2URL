# 🎯 Magnet2URL

Transform **magnet links** into **clickable HTTPS URLs** to use safely and conveniently in **Notion**, **Discord**, **Telegram**, or anywhere else where normal magnet links aren't recognized!


## 🚀 Functionality

This project converts magnet links into HTTPS URLs that, when clicked, redirect to your installed torrent client (like **qBittorrent**, **Deluge**, and others).

➡️ Ideal for:
- 🗂️ Sharing Magnet content in a user-friendly way
- 🧠 Pasting in Notion notes
- 💬 Sending in Discord groups and other networks



## ⚙️ How to use

1. Copy the published GitHub Pages link:
> 

2. Add the magnet link after the `#` character. Example:
> 

3. Open the link

🔗 When clicking this link:
- The browser attempts to open the link in your torrent client
- If not automatically redirected, an explanatory message with a tutorial will appear with the option to try again
 


## 📦 Compatibility

✅ Tested with:
- qBittorrent  
- Deluge  
- Transmission  
- WebTorrent  
- Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
